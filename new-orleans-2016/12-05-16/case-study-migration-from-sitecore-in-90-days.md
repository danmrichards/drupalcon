# Case Study: Brainshark - Migration from Sitecore in 90 days

## Existing Site Challenges

* No support and maintenance
* Security risks
* Poor template implementation resulted in design constraints
* Not user friendly
* No batch/bulk item publishing
* Licensing model
* Re-directs problematic
* Didn't want to host themselves
* Maintenance issues
* No wide adoption so finding the right people was a problem

## Business Needs

* Change CMS
* Rebrand
  * Move to Drupal
  * Re-skin
  * Re-do whole site
* Templatized and not coding every page

## Migrations

* Sitecore does things differently than Drupal
* Sitecore maps links/media by proprietary internal ID
* Design package within sitecore that contained all links/media
* Create custom migration script
* Items migrated
  * Homepage
  * Pages linked from home, nav and footer
  * Company pages
  * Blog
